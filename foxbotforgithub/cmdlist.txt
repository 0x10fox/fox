Fox the Moderation Bot, the cutest and most useful moderation bot to ever exist.
You can ban, warn, and kick like most bots, but also the bot logs every entry, exit and deleted message.
There is also a command to view edits of any message in a server! (see syntax below)
There are also some fun commands that may get a bit kinky OwO (see below)
